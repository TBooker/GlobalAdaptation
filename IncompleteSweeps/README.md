A Model For the Number of Incomplete Selective Sweeps
======

The model is probably best explained by the supplementary material of the paper. I used some classic population genetic results to derive an approximation for the number of incomplete selective sweeps going on in a panimictic population at any one time. 

Making Figure 5
------

I entered the model into Mathematica and used it to generate the data shown in Figure 5. 

The Mathematica file containing the model outlined in the supplement to the paper is included. It outputs the results from the model (takes a little while). 

The R script reads in the data generated by the Mathematica file and uses it to produce Figure 5 from the manuscript.

*I use the term "selective sweep" to refer to any advantageous mutation spreading to fixation, but note that it is really linked neutral sites that can be said to be undergoing selective sweeps.*
