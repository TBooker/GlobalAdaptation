Here is a Mathematica file containing the model in the supplement to the paper.

I use some classic population gentic results to derive an approximation for thenumber of incomplete selective sweeps going on in a popualtion at any one time. 

I use the term "selective sweep" to refer to any advantageous mutation spreading to fixation, but note that it is really  linked neutral sites that can be said to be undergoing selective sweeps. 

The R script reads in the data generated by the Mathematica file and uses it to produce Figure 5 from the manuscript.
