Global adaptation confounds the search for local adaptation
======

In this repo you'll find the scripts, config files and the plotting scripts that I used for our study [**"Global adaptation confounds the search for local adaptation"**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/742247v1).

There are three strands to this study: 
  1. [Simuations of a model of parapatry (or isolation with migration)](Parapatry/)
  2. [A population genetic model for the number of incomplete sweeps under panmixia](IncompleteSweeps/)
  3. [Simuations of a stepping-stone model](SteppingStone/)

If there is anything incomplete, you find bugs or you want clarification on anything, please don't hesitate to get in touch (my_last_name [at] zoology [dot] ubc [dot] ca)

**A Disclaimer** If you want to use any of this code, keep an eye on path names. I am lazy and generally hard-code in paths and directories

*Because the simulation data files are large, I cannot add the raw data to the GitHub repo. I will include summary data, but the full simulation data I analysed will be deposited on Dryad. I'll add a link to Dryad soon.*
