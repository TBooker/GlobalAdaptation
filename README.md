In this repo you'll find the scripts, config files and the plotting scripts that I used for our study **"Global adaptation confounds the search for local adaptation"**.

There are essentially three strands to this study. The first is a simulation study of a model of parapatry, or isolation with migration. I performed the simulations in SLiM 3.2 making use of the tree-recording feature. 


If there is anything incomplete, you find bugs or you want clarification on anything, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Because the simulation data files are large, I cannot add them to the GitHub repo. I'll be depositing them on Dryad, however, so I'l add a link to that once it's done.
